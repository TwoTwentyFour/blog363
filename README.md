# blog363

### What is this? ###
>A simple blog engine I use to write about what I'm learning, my interests and, from time to time, what I'm working on.
### How was this built?
>The initial project began as a CMS tutorial taken from Larry Ullman's book [Advanced PHP](http://www.larryullman.com/books/php-advanced-and-object-oriented-programming/). The site uses the _Business Frontpage_ template provided by [StartBootstrap.com](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/business-frontpage/).
### What are the plans for the site?
>I have a laundry list of things I want to add/change to the project. You can view them [here...](https://github.com/TwoTwentyFour/blog363/blob/master/misc/.todo.md).
